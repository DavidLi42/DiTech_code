Try to make a benchmark using kNN

convert all training data in one file

#### To Mrbean ####
* Data Cleaning Code is dcp.py
* Beside weather_data,traffic_data & time, I have included previous 3 gaps of each data points as their features as well. Just to remind you.
* didi_concat_data.ipynb is used to join training data different day to a single csv file.
* My knn code is in didi_knn_on_training_set.ipynb

The final MAE result on Training set is 1.538

To run `didi_knn_on_training_set.ipynb`, you only need to unzip TrainingData.zip
